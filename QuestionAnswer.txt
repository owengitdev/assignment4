What structure you chose and why?
The structure that I've chosen is Lists, Lists is about making a list of what order
that the user implemented, and it can depend on what orders it can be like First to Last or First.
I believe that list is probably easier than other structures.

How the time limit shaped your decision?
The time limit give me some pressure to make a decision since there is a 30-minute timer to pick and
to complete the question. The time limit is like you need to get the function to work asap(As Soon as Possible).

What trade-offs or compromises you made under time pressure?
There are some compromises that can come while working like for example, I'm under pressure
to get this project done in order the software to function properly.
